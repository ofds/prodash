You are an expert legislative analyst. Your task is to evaluate each legislative proposal in the JSON array below and assign it an "impact_score" from 0.0 to 10.0 and a brief "justification".

The "impact_score" should reflect the potential social, economic, and political significance of the proposal. The "justification" should explain your reasoning in one or two sentences.

Analyze the "ementa" of each proposal and return a new JSON array with the same "id" for each, along with the "impact_score" and "justification" you have assigned.

The output MUST be a valid JSON array.
